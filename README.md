  <h3>
    Particle Network Biconomy Example
  </h3>
</div>

‚ö°Ô∏è Example application for leveraging [Particle's Smart Wallet-as-a-Service](https://particle.network/) to facilitate ERC-4337 AA interaction with Biconomy's Paymaster. Specifically, sign-in and account management is handled by Particle, while the sending of a sample **gasless** transaction is handled by Biconomy.

Built using **Particle Auth Core**, **Particle AA SDK**, **TypeScript**, and **Ethers**

## üîë Particle Auth Core
Particle Auth Core, a component of Particle Network's Wallet-as-a-Service, enables seamless onboarding to an application-embedded MPC-TSS/AA wallet facilitated by social login, such as Google, GitHub, email, phone number, etc. - as an alternative to Particle Auth, the Auth Core SDK comes with more control over the modal itself, application-embedded popups rather than redirects, and so on.
